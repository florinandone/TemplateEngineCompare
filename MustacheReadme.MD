Mustache templates do not have a built-in mechanism for directly including content from another template as you can do with some other template engines like FreeMarker or Jinja2. Mustache is intentionally simple and does not support template inheritance or includes out of the box.

To include content from another template when using Mustache, you typically need to handle this at the application level by loading multiple Mustache templates, rendering them separately, and then combining the results in your application code.

Here's an example of how you might do this in Java using the Mustache library:

Suppose you have two Mustache templates: `main_template.mustache` and `imported_template.mustache`. You want to include the content of `imported_template.mustache` within `main_template.mustache`.

**main_template.mustache:**

```mustache
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Main Template</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Main Template Content</h1>
    
    {{{importedContent}}}
    
    <p>More content in the main template</p>
</body>
</html>
```

**imported_template.mustache:**

```mustache
<h2>Imported Template Content</h2>
<p>This content is imported from another template.</p>
```

In your Java code, you can load and render both templates separately and then combine the results:

```java
import com.github.mustachejava.DefaultMustacheFactory;
import com.github.mustachejava.Mustache;
import com.github.mustachejava.MustacheFactory;

import java.io.StringWriter;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MustacheFactory mf = new DefaultMustacheFactory();
        
        // Load the main template
        Mustache mainTemplate = mf.compile("main_template.mustache");

        // Load the imported template
        Mustache importedTemplate = mf.compile("imported_template.mustache");

        // Create a StringWriter to capture the output
        StringWriter writer = new StringWriter();

        // Render the imported template
        importedTemplate.execute(writer, new Object()).flush();

        // Get the output of the imported template
        String importedContent = writer.toString();

        // Create a context for the main template and add the imported content
        MainContext context = new MainContext();
        context.importedContent = importedContent;

        // Render the main template with the imported content
        mainTemplate.execute(writer, context).flush();

        // Print the final output
        System.out.println(writer.toString());
    }

    static class MainContext {
        String importedContent;
    }
}
```

In this example, we load and render the `imported_template.mustache` separately, capture its output, and then inject it into the `main_template.mustache` by setting it as a variable in the `MainContext` before rendering the main template. The result is a combined output that includes the content from both templates.

Keep in mind that this is a manual process because Mustache itself doesn't provide a built-in include directive. You need to load, render, and combine templates in your application code.
