# Popular Template Engines for Java

Java offers a variety of template engines for generating dynamic content in your applications. These template engines provide a way to separate code and presentation, making it easier to create dynamic web pages, reports, or documents. Here's a list of popular template engines used in the Java ecosystem:

1. **FreeMarker**: A versatile template engine with a simple and flexible syntax.

2. **Thymeleaf**: A server-side template engine known for its seamless integration with the Spring framework. It can also be used without Spring.

3. **Velocity (Apache Velocity)**: A template engine that focuses on simplicity and speed. Often used in conjunction with the Apache Struts framework.

4. **Jinjava**: A Java library for using Jinja2 templates, a popular template engine in the Python world.

5. **Mustache**: A logic-less template syntax that enforces separation of concerns between the template and data.

6. **Pebble**: A lightweight and extensible template engine inspired by Twig. Known for fast execution and flexibility.

7. **Handlebars.java**: A Java implementation of the Handlebars.js template language. Designed to be simple and expressive.

8. **Groovy Templates**: If you're using Groovy in your Java application, you can use Groovy's built-in template engines, including GStringTemplateEngine and SimpleTemplateEngine.

9. **StringTemplate**: A template engine that emphasizes strict separation of templates and data.

10. **Casper (Clojure Templating)**: If you're working with Clojure, consider using Casper, a templating library for Clojure.

The choice of a template engine depends on your specific requirements and preferences. Each of these engines has unique strengths and weaknesses, and your selection often depends on factors like ease of use, performance, integration with your application framework, and the type of templates you need to create.
